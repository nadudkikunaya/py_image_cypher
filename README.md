It's just an experiment by using python to cypher an image

The method is changing the bits of base_image to nearest even or odd value 
according to to_hide image which has the same size as the base_image 

If the bit color of to_hide is black then change the bit of base image in the same index to odd by -1 or +1
As well as the white bit of to_hide, change the bit of base image in the same index to even by -1 or +1


have fun!!!
