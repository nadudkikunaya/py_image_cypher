# What is this?
It's just an experiment by using python to cypher an image after learning Image Processing course.

## What is the cypher method?
The method is changing the bits of **base_image** to nearest even or odd value according to **to_hide** image which has the same size as the base_image 

- If the bit color of to_hide is black then change the bit of base image in the same index to odd by -1 or +1 (Already odd -> remain the value)
- As well as the white bit of to_hide, change the bit of base image in the same index to even by -1 or +1 (Already even -> remain the value)
